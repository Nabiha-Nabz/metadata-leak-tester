            <h3><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Our Mission</h3>
            <p>In today's digital world, we share files constantly - photos, documents, and more. But these files often contain hidden metadata that can reveal more than we intend. Our tool helps you understand what metadata is and what risks it might pose to your privacy and security.</p>

        <div class="about-card scale-on-hover">
            <h3><i class="fas fa-code"></i> How It Works</h3>
            <p>When you upload a file, our system extracts and analyzes the embedded metadata, categorizing it by risk level:</p>
            <ul class="risk-levels-list">
                <li><span class="risk-badge high-risk"><i class="fas fa-fire"></i> High Risk</span> - Potentially sensitive information like GPS locations</li>
                <li><span class="risk-badge medium-risk"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Medium Risk</span> - Information that could be used for profiling</li>
                <li><span class="risk-badge low-risk"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Low Risk</span> - Technical details with minimal privacy impact</li>
            </ul>
